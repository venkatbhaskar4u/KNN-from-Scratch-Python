# KNN-from-Scratch-Python

## Overview
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm from scratch using pure Python, without relying on libraries like scikit-learn. It showcases a deep understanding of supervised learning, distance metrics, and practical data handling for educational and evaluation purposes.

## Key Features
- Manual implementation of core KNN logic: calculating Euclidean distances and selecting nearest neighbors
- Flexible for any feature-based classification dataset
- Demonstrates data preprocessing and normalization
- Visualizes decision boundaries (if 2D or plotted dataset)
- Thorough step-by-step code comments for learning and interview preparation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, matplotlib (for optional visualization and array operations)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/venkatbhaskar4u/KNN-from-Scratch-Python.git`
2. Open `KNN_from_scratch.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to see code, experiment on sample data, and visualize results.

## Results & Example Outputs
- Example:  
Prediction accuracy of X% on test dataset  
Sample plot illustrating classification decision boundary
